## What is serverless?

![serverless logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intelygenz/serverless/master/assets/serverless.png)

[Serverless](https://serverless.com/) is your toolkit for deploying and operating serverless architectures. Focus on your application, not your infrastructure.

## How to use this image

You can run a [Serverless](https://serverless.com/) project by using this image directly, passing a [Serverless](https://serverless.com/) command to `docker run`:

    docker run -it --rm --name my-serverless-project -v "$(pwd)":/usr/src/myserverless -w /usr/src/myserverless intelygenz/serverless:1.67.3 deploy

### Building local Docker image (optional)

This is a base image that you can extend, so it has the bare minimum packages needed. If you add custom package(s) to the `Dockerfile`, then you can build your local Docker image like this:

    docker build --build-arg SERVERLESS_VERSION=1.67.3 --tag my_local_serverless:1.67.3
